# Notes:

- Three ways to add java script: Inine javascript, internal javascript and external javascript.
- For functions:

* Please note that if a method does not have a return keyword used inside it, then all functions by default in javascript return undefined.

- Please note the following difference:

* == checks only value
* === checks value and type

* document objects exists inside window object
* If one wants to find the properties and methods of an object in DOM, just use console.dir().

* In form tag, action attribute tells where will be sending the data.
